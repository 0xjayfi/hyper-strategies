## 1. How to Read Top 100 Holders With Nansen Before Tokens 10x

**Date:** Oct 29, 2025 | **Tweets:** 3

What does a 46,000% pump on $AIXBT, a 10,000% pump on $COAI, a 4,000% pump on $TIBBIR, and a 2,000% pump on $ASTER have in common?

High Top 100 holder concentration.

Learn to read this data correctly and on time, and you can front-run massive moves and profit from them

------

### 1. Why Do Top 100 Holders Even Matter?

The Top 100 Holders of a token are the 100 wallet addresses holding the largest amounts of that specific token.

When they control a very high percentage (e.g., 80%+), this typically means:

- Higher price volatility
- Potential for large market movements if they sell
- Less decentralized distribution

In Telegram groups, I constantly hear: "Top 100 hold 50%+ of supply. Unhealthy distribution, they'll dump on us as exit liquidity."

While there's truth to this concern, it completely lacks context. High Top 100 concentration can signal both massive opportunity and imminent rugpull. The difference lies in the pattern, timing, and composition.

------

### 2. Why Top 100 Concentration Can Be Bullish

For newly launched tokens especially, a high supply concentration signals dumping risk.

I often skip these plays, if there is no proper explanation or vesting for the top tokens. The risk is simply too high, especially with teams who say "you don't have to worry about anything ser."

I am not going to share the ticker here, but the last time I heard that phrase for a token last week, the token nuked 99%.

But "big money" Top 100 holders are also necessary as their accumulation can be extremely bullish. When they're net buyers (especially Smart Money, Funds, and Whales), it signals:

- Confidence (large holders risking significant capital)
- Reduced circulating supply creating squeeze dynamics
- Undervalued opportunity they've identified before the market
- Leadership that retail will follow eventually once visible

These type of holders often have superior research capabilities and earlier access to understanding of project developments. They accumulate before information becomes public, creating supply squeezes that could amplify price movements.

Other traders that look on-chain (like you and me) watch what these holders and other "smart market making segments" do, creating a follow-on effect once accumulation becomes visible.

------

### 3. Four Case Studies of Top 100 Patterns

Let's dig into four on-chain examples to understand what happened with Top 100 wallets and price action for a project.

**Example 1: $COAI (Manipulation Pattern)**

On Sep 25, Top 100 holders for $COAI increased from 5.67% to 98.23% in one day. Two weeks later, the price pumped 10,000%.

IMO this is textbook manipulation. The single-day accumulation of 92.56% is the red flag. There were probably plenty of reasons, but no organic accumulation ever looked like this.

Takeaway: Sudden, dramatic Top 100 increases (>75% in a day) could indicate manipulation, especially if there is no information. That doesn't mean you can't take the opportunity, just know what you're buying and the risk you're taking.

If I would have spotted this earlier, I would have taken the bet. And I am not saying this because of the 10,000% price pump that came afterwards. It's all about the risk to reward bet you're willing to take.

------

**Example 2: $AIXBT (Bullish Accumulation)**

For $AIXBT, the Top 100 holders gradually accumulated to around 85% by Nov 6. With most tokens locked in their hands, the available float became severely limited. Strong buying pressure on tiny supply, in the middle of an AI bull season, fuelled a 46,000% pump in under 3 months.

Takeaway: Key difference from $COAI here is that there was gradual accumulation with Smart Money labels visible.

------

**Example 3: $TIBBIR (Steady Conviction)**

Now for $TIBBIR, we saw a textbook Top 100 accumulation play. The token didn't have a sudden Top 100 increase. Instead, it grew steadily alongside price, showing a textbook example of how dedicated Top 100 holders affect price action.

As a matter of a fact, $TIBBIR is the only chart I've seen where Top 100 holders showed such consistent holding conviction. Currently sitting at 53% of supply (real wallets / holders, no big team vestings or multisigs), with almost everyone still holding. The correlation between Top 100 growth and price is nearly perfect.

Takeaway: When Top 100 grows steadily with price and holders maintain conviction through volatility, it signals genuine accumulation. This is the most important reason IMO why $TIBBIR grew so high in MC and almost hit $500M MC.

------

**Example 4: $ASTER (Artificial Scarcity)**

Top 100 controlled 96% from launch, with three multisigs holding 67.28%. At that time, around 4% (ish) was tradeable on DEXes.

This resulted in massive buying pressure on a tiny float, when KOLs hyped it as the "Hyperliquid killer backed by CZ." The result: a 2,000% pump on artificial scarcity in just one week.

Then onchain flow volatility increased and unlocks hit. Oct 13: 320M moved from multisig to vault. Oct 15: 399M to Binance. Price collapsed 60% (I've warned about this scenario on Oct 2).

Takeaway: Extreme concentration (>90%) from launch, especially in multisigs, combined with maximum hype and a tiny float, is a typical distribution setup. Smart Money and Top PnL knew this, caught the pump and front-runned the inevitable unlock. And look where we are at now.

------

### 4. Critical Considerations

Now before you dive into @nansen_ai to find similar opportunities, be aware of some considerations to get a better context about the data.

- CEX/DEX holdings: Top 100 (often) includes exchange wallets and LPs. When tokens die, Top 100 can increase from supply concentrating in dormant wallets, not new accumulation.
- Team unlocks: Sudden increases may be teams minting or unlocks (check CS vs FDV). If concentration rises from team unlocks rather than external buying, that's bearish.
- Smart contracts: Staking contracts and proxies can also appear in Top 100. Some stakings are flexible, while other contracts have a 7 day (or more) lockdown. Check what the addresses actually are.
- Cross-reference segments: Combine Top 100 with Smart Money netflows, Fund activity, and Top PnL traders. Multiple aligned signals increase conviction and the chances of catching your next runner.
- Market cap threshold: This whole approach doesn't work well for small MC's (sub $3-5M). At that size, high concentration usually means team holdings. Without transparent vesting/locks, this is risky.

------

### 5. Conclusion

Top 100 holder concentration is one of the strongest signals to monitor, but only when you understand the context.

Here's what most people miss: It's not just about how much the Top 100 hold. It's also about who they are and how they accumulated.

When you interpret the Top 100 correctly, it tells you who's in control, when conviction builds, and where the next move probably will start.

Master it, together with the other market making segments, and you have my word you'll consistently front-run the market

## 2. Nansen Mega Thread - 7 Categories With 16 Posts

**Date:** Nov 19, 2025 | **Tweets:** 28

Market conditions are tough now. The easiest thing is to leave. The hardest thing is to keep going.

If you want to level up your onchain game, this thread is for you.

It includes 7 categories with 16 posts that had the highest engagement and best insights.

### Category A - Hitting Gems

**A1** - Hitting a 38x on $JET2 based on smart money inflows onchain.

> 38x on JET2
> Some say Nansen's costs are too high.
> I agree, the opportunity costs are insane.
> You need to spend money to make money.
> You're not buying a tool, you're outsourcing on-chain intel to trade smarter.
> Alpha isn't free, but it's still cheaper than missing it.

**A2** - Hitting a 15x on $PRINT in choppy bear market conditions.

> We're just 50% away from a 30x, after hitting a 15x on $PRINT over the weekend. Not too shabby huh, in just one week.
> Fun fact: In the post below, I said it was only a matter of time before big KOLs noticed the breadcrumbs left by the $KOLIN team.

**A3** - Hitting a 15x on $HUCH based on wallet and whale tracking onchain.

> Yesterday I shared across multiple channels and groups that $HUCH was about to explode. It gave me the same vibes with an anxious daily candle, similar to what we saw when Jet2 ran 30x from my entry.
> Today, $HUCH already pumped 15x from my entry.

**A4** - Turned one smart money alert into a 25x on $AOL.

> Turned one smart money alert into a 25x.
> On July 21, I aped into $AOL at $1.6M MC after getting tipped and catching a smart money alert from one of my favorite wallets.
> Today it hit $40M -- all from one signal

### Category B - Cutting Through Twitter Noise

**B1** - Case study on $XPL launch showing what insiders, whales, and top traders actually did during the first week. While everyone was searching for answers on their TL, onchain gave the true answers and cleared all Twitter noise, resulting in a further 80% drop after the post.

> XPL (Plasma): Twitter Noise vs On-Chain Data - What Do You Trust More?
> I spent the last few hours analyzing $XPL, the Plasma blockchain token that launched 6 days ago (as of October 1, 2025).
> This post isn't a bottom or top signal, or a buy or sell recommendation. It's a case study.

**B2** - Case study on $STBL signaling distribution patterns and smart money leaving, while everyone else on my TL was absolutely bullish, calling for billions of MC. Result: $STBL dropped 85% after my post.

> Current $STBL Onchain Data: Distribution Patterns and Market Signals
> When smart money exits, retail often hold the bag right?
> Looks like this is happening right now with $STBL, at least for now. Here are the current onchain insights

**B3** - Case study on $EIGEN and onchain patterns. While many were max bull posting without mentioning risks, whales and institutions were quietly unstaking and preparing to exit ahead of the $47M monthly unlocks, leading to a 70% drop in $EIGEN's value.

> EIGEN: When Protocol Success Meets $47M Monthly Unlocks
> On October 10, the entire crypto market crashed on the tariff news. $EIGEN dropped 53% intraday, from $1.82 to $0.86. It looked like another market flash victim, but that's not the full story here.
> 68% of $EIGEN's most profitable traders were already positioned to exit.

### Category C - Recognizing Onchain Strength

**C1** - Three key indicators from $TIBBIR's onchain profile and movement pattern as input for catching the true winners.

> On June 23, I shared a post about $REI that ended up going viral with over 32k views.

### Category D - Finding Insider Wallets

**D1** - Finding insider wallets on $ORE that were positioned before the 4200%+ pump.

> $ORE is another gem that pumped out of nowhere, a 4200%+ run from $17 on Oct 17 to $604 on Nov 10.
> I haven't dived into the protocol or verified anything yet, but based on some posts, it looks like @OREsupply is generating strong daily revenue ($1M), with most of it going toward buybacks.

### Category E - Setting Up Smart Alerts

**E1** - An example of how you can act on insider information. In the example below, I received a smart alert for a fund that aped $IN before the Upbit listing and sold for 2x on the day it listed.

## 3. The Myth of ROI and Win Rate in Finding Alpha Wallets

**Date:** Dec 10, 2025 | **Tweets:** 2

Many platforms promote traders with 500% ROI and 90% win rates to attract copy traders. The perfect formula, right? Just copy trades and watch the profits roll in.

If these metrics were truly reliable, copy-trading would have created countless millionaires by now. We all know this isn't reality, and most of these statistics can't even be verified.

Even when you can validate the numbers with the right tools, interpretation isn't straightforward:

- A high win rate with low average ROI often reflects many small, low-impact wins
- A low win rate with high average ROI indicates fewer trades but significantly larger gains
- A wallet with 80% win rate could still lose money if their few losses are 10x larger than their wins
- Airdropped tokens that go to zero get counted as "trades" by many systems, artificially dragging down both metrics

Performance metrics require context. They're outputs of systems that calculate numbers without understanding the underlying behavior and strategy.

The alpha trader in the screenshot has just a 36% win rate over 180 days. Not impressive at first glance, right? Yet this wallet caught early positions in major runners like $ONA, $OLYN, $REI, $ZORA, and $FAI.

Filtering for high win rates and ROI would have completely missed this wallet.

This is why manual review remains essential. I spend hours analyzing wallets, studying behavior, conviction, and patterns to identify real alpha traders. Here's what I look for:

- Early positioning in true runners: wallets that entered before the move
- Conviction purchases: meaningful dollar amounts, not throwaway bets
- Focused portfolios: avoiding wallets that spray tiny entries across dozens of tokens
- Low token count per chain: often signals deep understanding rather than luck or FOMO

Alpha is found by understanding behavior, not blindly trusting surface-level metrics. And when multiple high-quality wallets show aligned behavior, the signal becomes significantly stronger.

## 4. Cracking the Crypto Game - Nansen Workflow, Candle Inspector, Wallet Tiers & $U1 Case Study

**Date:** Dec 15, 2025 | **Tweets:** 3

My Nansen Workflow to Evaluate Winners and Catch the Next One Yourself

This post highlights a case study for $U1 @Umbrae_Ignis. I show you how I use onchain data with @nansen_ai, to find informed capital, spot conviction early, and stop relying on average guesswork.

### 1. Who Dominates the Crypto Game

First things first.
Crypto is not random. It is dominated by a small group of stakeholders, each with a structural advantage and a different skill set:

- VCs get early access and discounts, control unlocks, and plan exits long before retail arrives.
- Insiders operate with asymmetric information like listings, partnerships, and vesting schedules.
- Whales move markets, create volatility, trigger liquidations, and accumulate during panic.
- KOLs turn attention into liquidity, often stimulated by promotional posts.
- Onchain sleuths read onchain behavior, not stories on your timeline. They track wallet flows, accumulation, and smart money rotation before narratives form.

(In case you were wondering where retail fits is - this the group that buys the bags of all the above stakeholders in the final stage of price action).

Becoming a VC, insider, or whale is unrealistic for most. Becoming a KOL takes years of audience building and networking.

That leaves one realistic edge to explore if you feel the hunger to find alpha: onchain sleuthing.

Leveraging transparency and decentralization - the key characteristics of blockchains - to track informed capital and front-run the crowd.

------

### 2. So you decide to focus on the latter group and to become an Onchain Sleuth, now what?

There is no free lunch in crypto.
You need to put in effort. Build up a track record with countless analyzed tokens, onchain flows and price movements.

But let's be honest: do you have the time, skillset, experience, energy, and tools to beat the top 1% of crypto?

A lot of people feel like they don't. But this was never the right question to begin with.

And that's because there are ALWAYS people that are better, smarter, earlier. People with more time, tools, funds, experience, connections, or a true investor mindset.

So what's the gameplan if it's so hard to become one of them?

Don't try to outcompete them - try to FIND them, this 1%, by leveraging on their skills and intelligence, so you can front-run the remaining 99% of the market.

------

### 3. Case study: $U1

In the section below, I show you a small part of my Nansen routine and how I study alpha plays to find wallets.

I use $U1 as a case study. @Umbrae_Ignis is a protocol that focuses on DLLM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) with a multi-chain focus on Base & Solana.

It is a project that was perfectly timed with a proper narrative, good team, and strong product-market fit. As a result, the project pumped hard.

But who was informed and positioned early?

Let's dig in.

**Part A: Inspecting the chart**

A1. Look for the first push and increase in volume

This is the chart of $U1. A project that launched early this month and was hovering between $50k - $670k MC for some time.

Then, it suddenly had increase in volume which resulted in a significant pump. On Dec 11, it skyrocketed to $9.3M, resulting in a 25x from that point in time.

As you can see, it had some traction in the beginning, but the real pump and volume occurred on Dec 11. This is the time window to inspect interesting candles.

A2. Find wallets with the candle inspector

Now let's investigate some candles manually. First, click on the Candle Inspector in @nansen_ai, then click on the candle to inspect. I prefer candles that were part of the first big push and volume increase.

A3. Look for wallets

In the lower part of the above screenshot, you see the wallets that bought during this specific candle. Now look for wallets with substantial buy-ins and wallets that are still holding most of their tokens.

This is important because wallets that aped in with proper size and still hold most of their tokens, were probably conviction buys that spotted the potential early.

When wallets still hold most of their tokens after a 25x, they knew what they bought, but also know what they are still holding.

**Part B: Inspecting the wallet**

B4. Assessing the PnL tab

Click on the wallet name and go to the PnL tab.

At first glance, this wallet doesn't look interesting:
- 22% ROI
- 20% Win Rate
- $20K PnL
- A lot of losses

Nine out of ten people would have skipped this wallet.

But here's the tricky part: performance metrics require context.

They're nothing more than the outputs of systems that don't think for you, and just calculate numbers, without understanding any form of underlying behavior, strategy or context.

(And fun fact: $U1 is not even part of the PnL tracker yet, meaning this performance data isn't displayed as part of this trader's ROI and PnL).

If it was really this simple, copy trading wallets based on strong metrics, then everyone would been rich by now, right?

So what actually does matters to me? Catching strong conviction early, before the run.

I see wallets solely as signals, not as copy-trade targets. High ROI and win rate help, but they're secondary.

What I really care about is:
- Sizeable entries: real capital deployed, not sprays of experimental dust
- Intentional positioning: wallets that don't scatter micro-buys across countless tokens (this creates a lot of noise when using alerts)
- Tight chain and protocol exposure: fewer positions per chain and protocols usually means expertise, not impulse
- Front-running the pump: consistently positioned ahead of momentum

**Part C: Inspecting front-running plays**

C5. Right-click on tokens and click "Wallet Profiler for Token"

This opens a new window where you can visually see their entry on the chart. Let's have a look at this specific wallet.

- **$U1**: A first buy early on, anticipating something big, followed by more buys as the speculation turned into reality. Still holding a large portion of the tokens.
- **$RAIN**: Looks a bit messy (he probably used a trading bot or something) but he was positioned very early. I already knew $RAIN from other top wallets I've tracked, so this is mainly more confirmation for me.
- **$RELO**: Not as early as some others, but a perfect buy during a volume and price pump, followed by a perfect sell at the top right when the chart was weakening, with no buys afterward. Again showing conviction rather than hesitation.
- **$ARGUS**: This is a play I'm interested in myself, largely because of some interesting wallets that aped into it early. Their activity adds another layer of confirmation, suggesting that the wallet we track here likely recognized the same strength and potential in the token.

**Part D: Other parts to explore**

This is just the tip of the iceberg of what I like to do. I also like to check out Top 100 holders, Top PnL wallets, and Smart Money and Whale inspection. The same method applies here.

------

### 4. Categorizing wallets and alerts

Each time you find such wallets, I label them into tiers (1-3):
- 1: Conviction wallets
- 2: Promising wallets
- 3: Informational wallets

Then I set alert and based on the new signals I get from them with @nansen_ai, I reassess and reorder their tiers.

With such a system, you can also categorize the importance of alerts on your phone.

------

### 5. Wrap-up

The goal here is not to outcompete the top 1%, but to leverage their intelligence.

By tracking onchain patterns, wallet behavior, and positioning, you turn raw data into signal. With a growing tracking database, patterns emerge, coordinated moves become visible, and conviction setups stand out.

System metrics alone will NOT give you alpha. Alpha comes from understanding behavior, and evaluating situations manually.

A last tip:
Make sure to share your work, collaborate, and build a network. By doing this myself, I have increased my network with a lot of nice and good onchain sleuthing chads. You will be amazed how many people are out there, like-minded like you, hungry to find onchain alpha.

This is how you stop guessing and start playing crypto with an edge.

This is the game of cracking crypto.

## 5. How to Read Smart Money Flows and Avoid Common Misinterpretations

**Date:** Dec 22, 2025 | **Tweets:** 3

"Smart Money" is everywhere on your timeline, but most posts are hype, noise, or misinterpreted data. Yet countless people choose to jump in, chasing signals they don't fully understand.

This guide shows how to read Smart Money flows properly, spot real signals, and avoid common traps.

------

### 1. The Common Misconception

Smart Money has become one of the most hyped buzzwords this year. The number of posts I have seen on my timeline about Smart Money is countless. It has become a marketing-driven term, used as a unique selling point by different tools and repeated by KOLs so often that it has become almost meaningless.

The term carries psychological weight. If you're not doing what "Smart Money" is doing, the implication is clear: you're doing something dumb. This makes it perfect for marketing. Tools use it as a selling point. KOLs repeat it until it becomes meaningless.

Someone spots a random $100k onchain flow, tweets "Wow guys, Smart Money is buying token X," and thirty bagholders commenting on the post confirming their bias. Another self-fulfilling CT narrative is born.

Here's another common example: Someone posts about an insight seen with @nansen_ai and declares, "BREAKING: Smart Money just increased by 300% on token Z"

Sounds impressive. Then you dig deeper and realize it's only a $15k net inflow on top of an existing $5k position, bringing the total to $20k on a token with a $3B MC. That's less than 0.001% of the supply. Worse, after further inspection, it was not even a buy, just a transfer from wallet A to wallet B.

These are just a few examples of what I encounter regularly: data that often feels random, lacks context, and represents only a small fraction of what you really need to analyze to make informed decisions. Much the same, many posts are shared for the sole purpose of posting.

------

### 2. What Is Smart Money?

Well, you tell me what it is. All I know it's becoming a term widely used on CT. That's why I like Nansen, since it provides a more structured approach by defining and tracking Smart Money systematically. Their Smart Money analytics help traders identify on-chain activity from high-performing wallets.

In Nansen's framework, Smart Money refers to a curated group of on-chain wallets with consistent evidence of strong performance or advanced trading behavior.

These wallets are selected using objective criteria that include:
- profitable and early entries in successful tokens
- strategic liquidity provision
- activity from funds or venture capital firms
- strong performance in airdrop farming
- MEV, arbitrage, and other advanced strategies

These Smart Money tags are derived from a massive amount of real on-chain data instead of opinions. When one of these wallets interacts with a token, the activity may indicate that the token deserves attention, but it does not confirm that it is a good investment.

This means a Smart Money signal should be treated as a starting point for investigation, not a direct reason to buy.

If interpreted correctly, however, these signals can be highly informative and potentially lucrative.

------

### 3. Case Studies of Successful Smart Money

Smart Money can also be seen as "informed money". In some cases, their activity can appear before sharp price pumps. This usually happens when well-informed participants position themselves ahead of catalysts that are not yet priced in, such as listings, upgrades, or narrative shifts. Their on-chain activity often shows up early, before broader attention and liquidity arrive, which can make it look like Smart Money "front ran" the move.

**1) $TIBBIR**

Around April, Smart Money showed significant inflows for $TIBBIR (yellow line), indicating growing interest and buying pressure. The grey line represents the price and shows what happened afterwards. By May 19, Smart Money experienced substantial outflows, primarily due to staking going live, a detail that could be misleading if you were unaware of it. Aside from this, the chart clearly demonstrates that Smart Money positioned early, ahead of the subsequent price pump.

**2) $RUSSELL**

Smart Money bought into the initial pump, accumulating over 4% of the token's supply. They maintained positions throughout the subsequent correction and are now holding as the next pump unfolds. Conviction shown through a correction is a strong signal.

**3) $WHITEWHALE**

$WHITEWHALE is another good example. Smart Money showed large inflows followed by outflows, which (after inspecting) indicated transfers rather than actual sells.

In my private server, I received three alerts when the MC was around $280k. This early activity eventually preceded a nearly 30x price increase, highlighting how tracking Smart Money flows can help identify early positioning ahead of major moves.

------

### 4. Evaluating Smart Money Flows

These examples worked but only because specific conditions were met. So does this mean you can simply ape each Smart Money flow?

No, not at all. While Smart Money signals can provide useful insights, there's still a lot to study and evaluate before drawing conclusions.

First of all, when Smart Money shows a net inflow, it means total inflows exceed outflows or there were only inflows. This can be meaningful, but only if the inflow represents actual buying activity.

Not all inflows are genuine accumulation and some data can lead to false signals:
- Sometimes an inflow is simply a wallet-to-wallet transfer, where the same owner moves tokens from Wallet A to Wallet B. These should not be interpreted as real accumulation.
- An inflow can be followed immediately by an outflow, resulting in no real net position. Although these flows lead to "Smart Money activity", it could indicate the owner spread their allocation across other wallets or simply sold part of it. Always verify that the wallet actually kept the tokens and determine what flows actually were there.
- Confirm that the token was not sold shortly after the inflow, in case Nansen missed an outflow.
- Check the percentage of Smart Money versus total supply. A very low percentage is unlikely to have any meaningful impact. A $20k position on a $3B MC is noise, not signal.
- Be aware of signals coming from smart contracts or staking, as these often do not reflect active market positioning. In the case of $TIBBIR, staking was displayed as a Smart Money outflow, while the staking was actually a bullish event, due to supply being (temporarily) locked.

Following Smart Money flows is not a shortcut. It requires careful context, verification, and analysis to separate genuine early accumulation from misleading data. Done correctly, it can highlight early positioning and potential trends, but it is never a replacement for thorough research.

------

### 5. Bugs, Data Errors and Abuse

Beyond interpreting flows, it is essential to confirm that the inflow is real and legitimate. Nansen, like any analytical tool, can display incorrect or incomplete transactions. This is logical, as tools rely on complex on-chain data and are constantly updated with new functionality. Bugs or delays in reporting can happen, so always verify unusual or suspicious activity before drawing conclusions.

Scammers also find ways to exploit the success of tools like @nansen_ai. Large airdrops to Public Figure wallets and Smart Money addresses can create the appearance of inflows and early interest, but in reality, the tokens were unsolicited. These flows were intentionally designed to trigger alerts, inflate perceived demand, and mislead anyone relying solely on headline numbers.

This is why every inflow must be validated manually. The transaction should make sense in the broader market context and not result from internal transfers, incorrect labels, errors, or manufactured flows. Treating every inflow as meaningful often leads to poor decisions.

### 6. Characteristics of High-Quality Inflows

Now that you have some background and context, it's easier to understand how to validate and interpret Smart Money data. Once you've confirmed that an inflow is real and legitimate, the next step is to determine whether it is strong enough to merit further research.

In my opinion, high-quality inflows usually share several characteristics:

- **Distribution across multiple receivers:** Healthy setups often show accumulation from several Smart Money wallets rather than a single buyer. Broader distribution indicates shared interest and increases signal reliability.
- **Meaningful purchase amounts:** Large purchases from individual wallets suggest genuine conviction. Multiple wallets buying around the same time often reflect coordinated interest or simultaneous recognition of an opportunity.
- **Strong total inflow relative to MC:** Significant inflows in dollar amount relative to a token's MC can indicate early positioning. This is especially relevant for new or low-cap tokens.
- **Quality of participating wallets:** Wallets with proven, consistent performance are more likely to identify strong opportunities early. A high-quality wallet entering with conviction carries more weight than a large inflow from an unproven or inconsistent address.
- **Timing of entry:** When a Smart Money inflow occurs is as important as who is buying and how much. Strong signals typically happen early in a token's price cycle, after initial launch volatility has settled, during consolidation, or while volume is gradually increasing and price holds clear support. Early positioning often coincides with clean breakout setups or higher lows forming on lower timeframes. Inflows during full momentum or after a vertical rally are much less informative.

The core principle is simple: strong Smart Money signals emerge when the chart shows potential energy, not after the move is already underway. Context determines whether an inflow is early or late. The same inflow that looks brilliant at the bottom can be meaningless at the top.

### 7. Final Thoughts

Smart Money signals can be extremely valuable when interpreted correctly. They highlight early activity, uncover hidden opportunities, and reveal where high-quality wallets are paying attention.

However, many people treat Smart Money signals and Nansen as a "holy grail" alpha machine and assume signals can be followed blindly. In reality, these signals are only the first step in understanding on-chain dynamics. Many Smart Money entries never lead to meaningful price action, which is why they should be used to investigate a thesis, not to chase a trade.

Tools can have incomplete or delayed data, and not every labeled wallet is always "smart." Platforms like Nansen are constantly indexing and updating information, which means every signal must be approached with caution and verified in context.

**Three-Step Action Framework**

When you spot a Smart Money signal:
1. Verify it's real -- Ensure it is not a transfer, bug, or manipulation.
2. Assess quality -- Evaluate size, timing, wallet reputation, and chart structure.
3. Use it as one data point -- Integrate it into broader research; never treat it as a standalone reason to enter a position.

Smart Money is a starting point, not a finish line.

Real edge comes from experience, a track record of reviewing countless past signals, and a clear framework for validation. Without that, Smart Money flows are just data. With it, they become a powerful decision-making tool.

## 6. $PIPPIN - Cartel Wallets, Whale Tracking & Cluster Alerts

**Date:** Dec 24, 2025 | **Tweets:** 3

While 99% of CT are gambling on $PIPPIN and getting short-squeezed, I'm focused on something else: informed wallets that were loading heavily right before the cartel-level cluster of wallets decided to revive this memecoin.

After inspecting 100+ wallets with @nansen_ai, I found a lot of interesting ones. Look at this one for example:

- A fresh wallet funded from HTX
- Received $250K USDT two months ago
- Bought SOL, then deployed ~$180K to buy $PIPPIN in a single day
- Currently holding ~$4.04M in unrealized $PIPPIN gains, with no selling or transfers so far

And this isn't an isolated case. There are many more like it. A large portion of these wallets haven't sold or transferred anything, which suggests their plan is much bigger: turning $PIPPIN into the next multi-billion-dollar meme. And then, in a blink, $PIPPIN will likely nuke harder than Terra Luna ever did.

This is obviously NFA, just my speculation based on what I am seeing on-chain.

I've bundled all of the wallets into different smart alert groups labeled with "cluster cartel" tiers. The moment any of them move funds or make their next play, I'll know first.

Sure, when whales operates at this level, it's unlikely these actors reuse the same wallets next time. But whales are people too, and people get lazy, make mistakes, or slip up. The moment one of them does, I'll know first.

## 7. How On-Chain Signals Revealed $WHITEWHALE Before the 100x

**Date:** Dec 27, 2025 | **Tweets:** 3

A deep dive into how multiple on-chain signals revealed $WHITEWHALE's massive potential, showing accumulation, smart money flows, and supply dynamics before the 100x move.

**Oct 13:**
- More than two months ago, $WHITEWHALE launched on Pump.fun. It bonded and topped around ~80k MC, then died off.
- Price action was basically flat from Oct 13 to Dec 2. Another dead meme, right?

**Dec 2:**
- Then on Dec 2, the supply held by the top 100 wallets suddenly dropped from 870M to 140M $WHITEWHALE, according to @nansen_ai.
- After checking the Exchange tab, it became clear the drop was mainly caused by a large outflow into the primary liquidity pool.
- TIP: When you see spikes like the above in top 100, this is ALWAYS a signal to investigate further. If you want to see what sudden changes in the top 100 can lead to, check my post on top 100 dynamics in the QRT below.

**Dec 4:**
- My first automated signal on my Discord server fired from multiple wallets I track (I am only showing one wallet in the screenshot, not sharing all the alpha here).
- Shortly after, I received a Smart Money inflow alert. Another followed an hour later, alongside a signal showing volume was increasing. On-chain boxes checked.

**Dec 7:**
- An official post from @TheWhiteWhaleV2 announced that he had taken over and CTO'd the meme (I am not diving into the drama that happened afterwards, this post is not about that).

**Dec 8:**
- From Dec 8 onward, the real top 100 holders, (thus excluding CEX/DEX wallets), increased their bags by over 80%, while exchange supply remained flat. I've been talking a lot about how important this is to pump a price.
- Beyond @TheWhiteWhaleV2 taking over, several other developments occurred. Examples include a treasury holding approximately $1M worth of crypto, roughly 35% of the $WHITEWHALE supply in the treasury as of now, multiple CEX listings, tokens locked until 2063, and giveaway campaigns and so on.

**Result:**

A perfect supply squeeze combined with improving project fundamentals and community hype resulted in vertical price action that reached 100x from the first signal I received.

**Conclusion:**

Did I catch it? Damn, no. I am still testing the server and was on the road when the first signal came in on my phone.

On top of that, I had not yet checked the Top 100 versus Exchange data at that moment in time. But if I had and if I had fully studied the on-chain footprint and potential, I would have 100% aped this hard.

I am not saying this in hindsight because the price pumped. I am saying it because $WHITEWHALE checked every on-chain box I look out for:

- Wallets I track showed attention
- Smart Money involvement
- A bullish chart structure
- Volume expansion after the first signals
- Supply aggressively withdrawn from the LP
- Project fundamentals and hype
- Flat exchange supply while top holders kept accumulating

All signals aligned. With a bit of luck, the bet would have been justified and the outcome proved it, like we see now.

At the very least, this gave me a clean on-chain setup to analyze and learn from. When the next opportunity comes, I will be ready. Because most of the pumps I've seen always follow the similar flows and pattern, which I have implemented in my overall framework.

The real value of on-chain signals is spotting conviction and positioning before the price action.

## 8. The Real Reason $WHITEWHALE Keeps Pumping - Position Management, Top 40 Monitoring & Alerts

**Date:** Dec 29, 2025 | **Tweets:** 3

On Dec 4, I received multiple on-chain signals for $WHITEWHALE, which eventually turned into a 200x+ runner. I forgot to check one thing (see QRT below) and faded my entry, so yes, I feel a bit salty.

But $WHITEWHALE is also showing what I have been preaching for a long time.

The reason it keeps pumping comes down to two main factors: centralized supply control and community hype/belief, both led by a strong individual.

The price action is just a secondary effect of these forces. It truly gives me joy to see that @TheWhiteWhaleV2 fully understand the effect of this.

But let's say you're holding a large portion of $WHITEWHALE, now what?

Here is a tutorial on how I manage my own large holdings, using $WHITEWHALE as a case study.

------

### First things first

If you have been following me, you know I have emphasized the importance of supply dynamics, which includes tokenomics, vestings, and unlocks, combined with onchain market-making segments.

IMO, both categories determine the potential strength of a play, as I have seen so many times.

As for $WHITEWHALE, the team now holds 35% of the supply, showing in real time exactly what I mean by this.

As long as the team continues holding or increasing their position (treasury), and other top holders (whales) keep adding, this trend will likely continue.

But the opposite can obviously happen as well.

Here is what's happening on-chain with $WHITEWHALE and how I would manage my position, focusing on supply squeeze dynamics and the flows of top holders.

------

### Step 1: Investigate Top 40 Holders

Just like any other S&P 500 company, the $WHITEWHALE team delivers periodic financial reports of their treasury to their most important shareholders.

Based on their latest report, I inspected each wallet and smart contract and highlighted them in the Top 100 Holders section by using @nansen_ai.

To do this yourself, go to Nansen, add the contract address for $WHITEWHALE, and click the Top 100 Addresses section.

Finding these addresses took some time because they were not always visible or were "diluted" by public vaults such as @DeFiTuna.

------

### Step 2: Custom Label the Team's Treasury

The next step is to bundle these wallets under one custom label. Click each wallet, add a label by giving it a name you prefer. Once done, you can filter them in the Top 100 section to see what is happening.

It is important to monitor inflows to these wallets, as more inflows potentially indicate accumulation.

Keep in mind though, that some of these wallets are also used for liquidity support. For example, if the price range of the @orca_so LP is reached, there may be sells from the LP. However, these sells may be offset by buys from the market, which is actually bullish. This is just one example to consider when inspecting flows. Context matters.

PS: The team did something smart here. By depositing 250M $WHITEWHALE into the ORCA LP within a very high price range of 3,700 to 37,000% above the current price, other tools do not recognize this as "top-holder holdings". Treasury holdings are basically being disguised here as liquidity. This reduces or eliminates concentration warnings, which matters for the 2% of people who actually look at onchain tools without any form of deeper investigation.

------

### Step 3: Create Manual Smart Alerts

Now that you have identified the wallets, create manual alerts for the custom labels you just added.

Give the alert a recognizable name so you know what it represents and how to interpret it, when it fires. Alerts can be sent to Telegram or via a webhook to Discord.

------

### Step 4: Repeat the Process for Other Top Holders

After identifying and labeling the team's wallets, exclude LP (DEX) or CEX holdings. This leaves the rest of the Top 40 holders, which is your second category to monitor. Label them, for example, "Top 40 Whales $WHITEWHALE," and repeat all the steps.

Monitor inflows for these wallets. Do not panic immediately if you see outflows, as these can be routine transfers as well. Always confirm on-chain what happened.

------

### Step 5: Key Checks and Scenarios

Monitor both the team and top 40 holder activity as the strongest indicators of $WHITEWHALE's trend. The flows of both categories should provide a high-level view of what is happening.

- **Bullish:** Team up, top 40 up --> continued growth. Both the team and whales are accumulating, showing strong confidence and coordinated support. Price is likely to keep rising.
- **Neutral:** Team stable, top 40 stable --> consolidation. Holdings remain steady, indicating no major moves. Expect sideways price action or minor fluctuations.
- **Bearish:** Team down, top 40 down --> potential pullback. Both team and whales reduce their positions, signaling risk. Price may face downward pressure or a correction.

Focus on these metrics with your Nansen labels and alerts. Remember, price is secondary, real insight comes from understanding where the supply is moving.

Also don't forget to update the above categories once in a while. For example, new top 40 holders could join, others could sell etc.

------

### Some Final Thoughts

I am very pleased to see $WHITEWHALE running this hard. I truly hope it reaches millions or even billions in MC, even while I am sidelined. I have multiple reasons for this:

**1. White Whale himself transformed from victim to a hero**

After the MEXC drama, where @TheWhiteWhaleV2 was falsely accused, a massive social media campaign with support from @zachxbt helped him win. This is an important moment for the space, highlighting the dangers and centralized power we often see with CEXes.

**2. When handled properly tokens can still pump**

$WHITEWHALE demonstrates that memes (or even any token), if managed properly, can still be highly lucrative. Many thought the space was doomed, but this project brings hope and sets a positive tone for 2026 IMO.

**3. Supply dynamics and onchain flows matter**

$WHITEWHALE shows the importance of supply dynamics. Supply dynamics including tokenomics, vestings, and unlocks, combined with market-making segments, determine the strength of a play. Let this set an example for all project teams and devs.

**4. Validation of my signals and framework**

Seeing $WHITEWHALE confirms that my signals and insights were accurate in hindsight. This strengthens my confidence in my framework for identifying future runners.

**But, be aware of the hype train:**

Sure, $WHITEWHALE could do another 100x from here, who knows. But let us be realistic. Holding such runners feels amazing, but as a holder, seeing constant bullposts on X can feed confirmation bias and make it hard to stay objective.

Remember, charts that go straight up often come down just as fast. I have been in this situation countless times and ended up roundtripping because I followed hype instead of on-chain data.

Therefore, make sure to close your timeline now and then, and understand the most important flows (top 40 holders), using custom labels and smart alerts with Nansen.

Because the moment something shifts, you will know first, because price is just a secondary result of these dynamics.
